 * @Description: 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
 -->
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```
